<p class="wow slideInRight"> A Complete New Makeover!</h2></p>
</header>
<p>This robot is led by; Director of Engineering, Richard Tsai,Vice President, Herb Hagemann, Tresurer/Director of Public Relations, Bhavesh Patel, Director of Engineering Notebook, Kanishk Kumar, and other students.
    For the first time, this robot, too made it to semifinals at LFNY. 
    Paired with 11040B, this Herricks team was truly instoppable. Although they did not receive an award, all of Herricks Robotics believes that the Excellence Award was distributed to both teams.
    This is due to the fact that both were splendid, and did remarkable during and before the Elimination Round.
    This robot is truly a speedster, with eight motors powering the robot.
    This robot definitely generates the message, "Don't mess with me", as its speed is no joke.</p>

</p>
Led by our President, herself, Caitlin Chou, Director of Programming, Christopher Lo, Public Relations, Amanda Chiang, Public Outreach Officer, Chloe Chu, and other students, this robot is a marvel in itself. 
With an intake claw and a mobile lift goal, this robot is everything needed for the competition. 
All of the competitions so far, 11040B has made it to the semifinals, very impressive indeed.  
This robot did receive the Judges Award, and has also got the Excellence Award.
This award has said to be the highest award presented in the VEX Robotics Competition. 
This award is usually presented to a team that exemplifies overall excellence in creating a high-quality VEX Robotics program.
This team is definitely a strong contender in numerous award categories, such as the Judges Award.
Our Engineering Notebook was definitely over the top, done by Amanda Chiang, and Chloe Chu.
As we turn each page, we can evidently see amount of hard work and sweat put into this Engineering Notebook.
This notebook is so good, that the judges at LFNY even took pictures of it, and called it, "a model Engineering Notebok".
Hats off to Chloe and Amanda for putting together an amazing Notebook.<br/><br/><br/></p>
