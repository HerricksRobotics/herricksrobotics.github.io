<h1>Our VEX Robots</h1>
<h2>11040A<br />
        A Complete New Makeover!</h2>
</header>
<p>Now, after the makeover, the robot is looking its best. Since the visit to the twilight zone,
    the robot is thriving and speed hungry, as it has 8 motors - 4 for each wheel! It can now beat Usain Bolt!
    Just kidding, it is not that fast, but it can beat any average VEX robot. One factor partially contributing
    to the incredible speed is the weight of the robot. Since it only has a mobile goal lift, the robot is not
    over working itself just to stabilize itself. </p>


<h2>11040B<br />
    A Close Victory...A Victory For Sure Next Competition</h2>
</header>
</p>
<p class="wow slideInRight">Led by our President, herself, Caitlin Chou, Director of Programming, Christopher Lo, Public Relations, Amanda Chiang, and other students, this robot is a marvel in itself. With an intake claw, and a mobile lift goal, this robot is everything needed for the competition. </p>
<p class="wow slideInRight"> Last competition, this robot almost made it to finals, but was sadly eliminated in a nail-bitting semifinals. Though, this robot did receive the Judges Award, 11040B is aiming for states this year. Many members of 11040B agree that the first competition's ourcome was the first and last time they would end up as semifinalists. They vowed to make their robot the best, so that it would guarentee them a spot in states, nationals, and even worlds</p>
<p class="wow slideInRight"> This robot did not get any major changes, just some touchup details. One thing that did change is the mobile goal lift. During the competition, the mobile goal lift was not the best it could be, and, so the members of 11040B decided to take a whole new approach to it. Now, the mobile goal lift has supports built into the frame of the robot, and it is powered by 2 motors, giving it more strength. Furthermore, the mobile goal lift now has a wider piece to pick up the cone, as this requires less precision and will be more effiecient. <br/><br/><br/></p>
