<p class="wow slideInRight"><h2><em>11040A</em><br /></p>
<p class="wow slideInRight"> A Complete New Makeover!</h2></p>
</header>
<p>This robot is led by Richard Tsai, Herb Hagemann, Bhavesh Patel, and Kanishk Kumar.
    Now, after a much-needed makeover, the robot is looking its best. 
    Since the visit to the twilight zone, the robot is thriving and speed hungry, as it has 8 motors - 4 for each wheel!
    It can now beat Usain Bolt! Just kidding, it is not as fast, but it can beat any average VEX robot. 
    One factor partially contributing to the incredible speed is the weight of the robot. 
    Since it only has a mobile goal lift, the robot is not overworking itself just to stabilize itself. </p>


<p class="wow slideInRight"><h2><em>11040B</em><br /></p>
    <p class="wow slideInRight">A Close Victory...A Victory For Sure Next Competition</h2></p>
</header>
</p>
Led by our President, herself, Caitlin Chou, Director of Programming, Christopher Lo, Public Relations, Amanda Chiang, and other students, this robot is a marvel in itself. 
With an intake claw and a mobile lift goal, this robot is everything needed for the competition. 
Last competition, this robot almost made it to finals but was sadly eliminated in a nail-biting semifinals round. 
Though this robot did receive the Judges Award, 11040B is aiming for states this year. 
Many members of 11040B agree that the first competition's outcome was the first and last time they would end up as semifinalists. 
They vowed to make their robot the best so that it would guarantee them a spot in states, nationals, and even worlds
This robot did not get any major changes, just some touchup details. One thing that did change is the mobile goal lift. 
During the competition, the mobile goal lift was not the best it could be, and,
so the members of 11040B decided to take a whole new approach to it.
Now, the mobile goal lift has supports built into the frame of the robot, 
and it is powered by 2 motors, giving it more strength. 
Furthermore, the mobile goal lift now has a wider piece to pick up the cone, as this requires less precision and will be more efficient. <br/><br/><br/></p>
