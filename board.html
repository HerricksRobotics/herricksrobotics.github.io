                                    Being able to effectively communicate her ideas, we are able to come up with great designs. We wouldn't be where we are without her amazing personality and talents!</p>

								<p> He has been in the club since his freshmen year.
                                    He truly is able to keep this club running with his novel methods of fundraising.
                                    With a recent idea, he was able to around $2000 from just donations.
                                    Without him, there's no way that our club would have the proper funding necessary to run.
                                    Bhavesh has an outgoing and funny personality.
                                    He leads the PR Committee and is a key member of 11040A and 11040B.</p>

                                Although she is the head of the Game committee, she is also a prominent member of 11040B, engineering alongside them.
