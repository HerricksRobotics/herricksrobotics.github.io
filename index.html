							<p class="wow slideInLeft">The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by Stacking Cones on Goals,
								by Scoring Mobile Goals in Goal Zones, by having the Highest Stacks, and by Parking Robots.
								There are eighty (80) Cones that can be Stacked on ten (10) Goals [5 per Alliance] during a Match.
								Some cones begin in designated locations on the field, while others are available to be entered into the field during the Match.
								Each Robot (smaller than 18”x18”x18”) begins a match on one of their Alliance Starting Tiles.
								Each Alliance has three Zones in which they can place their Goals. Alliances earn points for Stacking Cones on Goals,
								Scoring Mobile Goals in Goal Zones, having the Highest Stacks, and by Parking Robots.
								A bonus is awarded to the Alliance that has the most total points at the end of the Autonomous Period. </p><br><br>

							<p class="wow slideInRight"> Last competition, one of our robots - 11040B almost made it to finals, but was sadly eliminated in a nail-bitting semifinals. 
								Though, this robot did receive the Judges Award, both robots are aiming for states this year. Many members of Robotics agree that the first 
								competition's outcome was the first and last time they would end up as semifinalists and quarterfinalists. They vowed to make their robots the best,
								so that it would guarentee them spots in states, nationals, and even worlds!</p>
							<p class="wow slideInRight"> This club is one of the largest clubs in all of Herricks High School. Herricks Robotics Club meets on Tuesdays from 3 to 4:30 in the tech room.
								Our door is always open to new members, whether they are freshmen, or seniors. When competitions start approaching, we go into overdrive,
								more meetings, and each meeting longer than the last. We consider ourselves as very organized individuals who do not know the definition of pulling an all-nighter.
								We would love any new members, just come and speak to any robotics member on how to sign up, and any questions you have regarding Robotics Club.</p>
