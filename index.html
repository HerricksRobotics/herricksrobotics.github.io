							<p class="wow slideInRight">Amazing job at the competition at LFNY, New York to those who attended, and great work to everyone. 
								Our hard work paid off today in our recognition through the Excellence Award, which qualifies us for States and National Championships.
								We showed everyone that through teamwork, perseverance, and talent, Herricks Robotics can succeed.
								Both of our robots were allies in the finals, but unfortunately experienced technical difficulties in the semifinals once again.
								Congrats to team 11040B on the amazing robot, outstanding engineering notebook, and enthusiasm that resulted in the Excellence Award!
								Great job to everyone with high spirit, great scouting, and the passion for robotics that will carry both teams forward in our next competitions. 
								Our team as a whole was truly one of the best there, and with a drive to win, we will get far this season!
								</p>
						
							<p class="wow slideInRight">In the first competition, that took place at Carle Place, Long Island, team 11040B received the Judges Award.
								The Judges Award is presented to a team that the Judges determine is deserving of special recognition. 
								One of the key reasons for getting this award was our amazing sportsmanship and chanting, carrying our team, a
								nd powering our drivers to the semifinals.
								At semifinals, due to technical reasons, our robot could not advance to finals. 
								The team members of 11040B were contempt with this award but knew that another award should be won.
								In other words, they knew that this was only the stepping stone for where their robot could go. </p>
						
							<p class="wow slideInRight"> This club is one of the largest clubs in all of Herricks High School. Herricks Robotics Club meets on Tuesdays from 3 to 4:30 in the tech room.
								Our door is always open to new members, whether they are freshmen, or seniors. When competitions start approaching, we go into overdrive,
								more meetings, and each meeting longer than the last. We consider ourselves as very organized individuals who do not know the definition of pulling an all-nighter.
								We would love any new members, just come and speak to any robotics member on how to sign up, and any questions you have regarding Robotics Club.</p>

							<p class="wow slideInLeft">We work hard for everything. From 11040A to 11040B, we work with everything we've got, to
							put together the best robots possible. We do not believe in going the easy way, we wish to go the correct way. 
							Our principle is to attain perfection or to get as close to it as possible.
							We know that we need to work for our robots to be the best.</p>

							<p class="wow slideInUp">All of Herricks High School's Robotics Club knows that all of this is only possible because of our mentors,
							particularly, all of the Board Members. They constantly motivate us, and help us. 
							They get in the deep end, and teach us to carry on the legacy of the board members.
							They are Herricks Robotics Club's heart, vital oragans, brain, and backbone. 
							Without them, we would be nowhere compared to where we are now.</p>

							<p class="wow slideInRight">Without any of these two reactants, and many more factors, success would not be possible. 
							One success, we have faced already is the excellence award, another the judges award and semifinalists in all of our competitions.
							We are very proud of this, and we hope to see more success at future competitions.</p>
